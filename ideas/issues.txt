[TicTacToe][either the runGame func/ or the compmove func][COLD BE infinite loop bug][

	reproduction:

		terminal:
		///ran Tictactoe///

		are you alone? y for yes and n for no please.y
		alright! you'll play with Ultron :)
		Player 1, do you wanna go first? y for yes and n for no please.n
		Ultron will go first. be careful from his moves.

		^C

		Traceback (most recent call last):
			File "MainFrame.py", line 51, in <module>
				Tic.runGame()
			File "TicTacToe.py", line 223, in runGame
				compmove()
			File "TicTacToe.py", line 100, in compmove

		KeyboardInterrupt


		update #01:

			///from test.py:///

			def compmove(): 
				'''Function that chooses the comp move based on random choice built in function and stores it in (slots) list'''


				state=bool
				while state != True:    
					# x =choice(list(range(8))) causes some error.. I don't know
					x = choice([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
					print(x)
					y=emptyspace(x)
					print(y)
					state=y 
					print(state)    
				if state == True:
					slots[x]='Z'
					shwBoard(slots)

			doing this will print false all the time, which means there's a problem with the emptyspace function (probably)

		moving from 4 to 2 when p2 is in 3 produces a (you can't jump) error.

			instead of a mathematical approach, try a list of sets of all the possible "2 square" jumps
